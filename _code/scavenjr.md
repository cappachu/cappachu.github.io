scavenjr is an experimental visual web parser. Web pages are created for humans to consume. Even poorly designed webpages often have visual cues that assist with perceptive grouping. Loosely drawing from gestalt theory, scavenjr clusters the content of web pages and returns a relational data set that is easy to munge with clojure. (still brewing).
